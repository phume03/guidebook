# The Open Source Way #

[The Open Source Way](https://www.theopensourceway.org/) is a guidebook for anyone interested in managing open source work. It collects best practices for initiating, nurturing, growing, and maintaining open source groups. Look at this guide's table of contents, and note the organizational flow: from user to participant to contributor. This arrangement specifically tracks our view of how a community comes about and grows. And it all starts with a need. If you've worked in open source projects and communities, you've likely seen the cycle many times. It goes something like this:

    1. A person or group addressing a problem creates the first iteration of software that offers one solution to that problem.

    1. Other people with similar needs start using it, forming the core of a userbase.

    1. From the userbase arise enthusiasts, people who promote the software and the community emerging around it (that is, the values and principles that project seems to espouse).

    1. Eventually arising from the users and the enthusiasts come people who are interested in (and have grown capable of) contributing to the software in some way; they ensure the project remains active and responds to the changing nature of the problem for which it was originally developed.

Thus, the primary and continual focus for a project is to take good care of your users, for some of them will become your contributors, and you want them to do it out of love more than resentment.

A key element of all this is recognizing the value in contributions of all types, at all levels. Rather than valorizing only a single type of contribution, the best practice is to treat all manner of gifts to the project as equal. These contributions comprise content and code, hours and effort, and all types of broad contributions for the project via events, discussion forums, infrastructure maintenance, and so on.

When you lower barriers to participation, you make your project welcoming at all levels. This doesn't mean you remove all barriersâ€”just lower most of them appropriately. Appropriate barriers are necessary for someone receiving keys to systems, for example, and these barriers are different from those allowing only certain participants to contribute a help article or a patch to the configuration management system.
